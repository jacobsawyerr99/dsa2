# Traveling Salesman Problem

The classic "traveling salesman problem" asks a simple question: Given a list of nodes and distances between those nodes, what is the shortest/ most optimal route to vist each of those nodes exactly once and then return to the start point? This is an implementation of the solution to this problem using Python. The selected datastructure we use is a hashmap and we use a greedy algorithm to optimize.
